# Landing Page

## Michael Driscoll

### Approach

Whenever I am doing front end work I find it is best to take a moment to gather all the resources I need and assess what I can do with wehat I have and what else I will need before moving forward.  I start by creating my folder and files, getting a remote repository up and running and put some test text on the page to make sure that everything is good to go.  I see that I have a folder with 6 images and it looks like I will need 4 of them and after testing to make sure that HTML takes all the image formats I see that I will need to go ahead and convert one of them (the .psd).  I find a site where I can convert the psd, convert it to a png and put the images in an image folder.

### Methods

After taking a look at the mockup design I get the images onto the page and adjust their sizes so I can see a rough version of the layout.  I bring up my Digital Color Meter to get the colors I need and make some tags for the header, main section and the footer.  Early on I went back and forth a bit with the background image to see what the best way to put that on the page with elements overlapping it will be.  After some trial and error working with an image tag and putting it in the background as a background image with CSS I settle on an image tag and using 'position: absolute;' on the city image and laying in the other elements with 'position: relative;' and 'z-index: 1;'.

At this point I get the text on the page that needs to be there and the colors for the text laid out in CSS.  I also work on getting forms, buttons, icons and the opaque element with the sign up prompt and forms on it into place.  This is not done in one fell swoop but rather intermittently as I work on whatever areas i think could use attention next and somewhere in the process draw up some pen and paper mock ups of how the page can be laid out and put borders of different colors on most of the elements for reference as I move items around the page.
